<h1>SparrowSurf Help</h1>
<h2>First steps</h2>
<p>Before you can start browsing you have to select a CORS proxy in the preferences. Tap the top bar to open them and scroll down to the general preferences. There you can select a proxy. Note that the provider of this proxy can monitor which pages you view.</p>
<p>While you are there you can also review and adapt the other preferences.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>SparrowSurf is mainly meant as a substitute browser for pages that don’t properly show in the default browser in FFOS. There are problems in two different areas: Some sites use certificates unknown to FFOS (in most cases you can accept the certificate manually, but there are some cases where this does not work or where embedded ressources don’t load), and some sites rely on modern JS or CSS and break in older browsers.</p>
<p>SparrowSurf addresses these problems by loading some (or if necessary: all) content via a proxy and by modifying sites to remove all JS by default and optionally also all CSS. For some important sites special CSS is added to fix issues.</p>
<p>SparrowSurf can also remove images, videos and other things to save bandwidth and make pages load faster. In future versions it will be possible to store pages for offline usage.</p>

<h2>Restrictions</h2>
<p>Because of its design, SparrowSurf has some restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have to rely on the operator of the proxy for privacy and data integrity.</li>
<li>Pages cannot properly use cookies, so some sites will not work and you will not be able to log into any accounts.</li>
<li>Pages can only load via GET, so forms that use POST will not work. (In a few cases SparrowSurf will use GET for some forms instead.)</li>
<li>Redirects are only poorly supported.</li>
<li>Due to changed paths some JS and some web fonts will not work correctly, but by default they are disabled anyway.</li>
<li>An attacker could read your bookmarks, history etc. with a specially crafted page. This is unlikely, but not impossible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any other problems are probably bugs and you should report them to me.</p>
<p>When a page does not properly display (e.g. a menu partially covering the page) because it relies on modern CSS or JS you have several options:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can add additional CSS for that site.</li>
<li>You can disable CSS for that site.</li>
<li>You can view the HTML source code by adding <code>view-source:</code> in front of the URL (also available via the context menu).</li>
</ul>
<p>For important sites you can also tell me about the problems. Using internal mechanisms I can inject not only additional CSS, but also JS and have some more options to improve a site.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Using SparrowSurf should be self-explanatory in most cases. Tap the top bar to show or hide the settings. From there you have access to:</p>
<p><b>Navigation bar:</b> Go back or forward, reload the current page, show the history for the current tab (to go back or forward by more than one step), (un)bookmark the current page (also allows you to install search engines), store a page for offline usage (not implemented yet), share it or open it in another browser.</p>
<p><b>URL bar:</b> Enter a new URL. You can search through the top pages, your bookmarks, the history, or start a web search. You can also use the edit function to remove history entries and search engines.</p>
<p><b>Tabs:</b> Open a new tab, switch to another tab already open or close them.</p>
<p><b>General preferences:</b> Change the default preferences for all sites.</p>
<p><b>Site preferences:</b> Change the preferences for the current site, overriding the general defaults.</p>

<h2>Future plans</h2>
<p>Some features I plan for the future:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add additional CSS/JS for more pages to fix small problems.</li>
<li>Allow zooming pages.</li>
<li>Allow saving pages offline.</p>
</ul>
<p>I also have some more ideas. If you also have some additional wishes feel free to tell me about them.</p>
